However, it still seems strange that tank items like FH not only provide worse stats but also worse late game scaling.</p>\\n\\n<p>If Riot thinks FH is too strong, then why not just increase the cost but keep the stats the same? Tanks already have difficulty farming quickly or getting kills to snowball so why make them worse even in the best late game scenario? Much of their damage is % health based so isn&#039;t even that high except against other tanks. Furthermore, all tank items even before these changes fell off  late game compared to damage oriented champs simply because 35% of their stats were ignored due to LW &amp; VS. </p>\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, Skarner can nearly 1-shot whoever he ults. as fast as I snap my fingers.

We've been looking at a series of sub groups with that larger fighter group as a result as follows:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Juggernauts - Immobile, tough, build one to two offensive items on average (e.g. Nasus or Garen)</li>\\n<li>Divers - Pretty mobile, and really good at getting onto specific targets they want to kill, builds a little bit more offensively than juggernauts (e.g. Irelia or Xin Zhao)</li>\\n<li>Light fighters (need a better name for this group - Highly mobile, builds almost entirely offense, often good at killing multiple targets, usually squishy with windowed defense of evasieness (e.g. Trynd or Fiora).</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Biggest contrast between tanks and juggernauts is in what each group is trying do. Tanks are generally trying to initiate or peel more, kill by themselves less. They build almost mainly (sometimes exclusively) defense/utility and have a greater amount of mobility, generally tied to initiation or peeling actions. </p>\\n\\n<p>As far as other juggernauts go, Olaf, Shyvana are the next two we're planning on looking at. Yorick's arguably a juggernaut, he'll get a full relaunch though. Volibear could be described as a juggernaut, though he's also got some diver and tank bits to him.

Before that I was a lead designer on Age of Empires for 10 years. Before that, I was an oceanographer, which is where the crustacean avatar came from. I was an army brat who lived lots of places, but I identify most as a Texan.</p>\\n\\n<p>My favorite game of all time is Dungeons and Dragons. I have played for 30 years, in all 5 editions.  For video games, I&rsquo;ll just list broad families of games that I love and that have influenced me: XCOM, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, Chrono Trigger, Diablo, Doom, Civilization, Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls, Baldur&rsquo;s Gate, Planescape: Torment, Mass Effect, Metroid, Grand Theft Auto, and Okami. Outside of games, I enjoy travel, reading about history and science, and being outdoors. My last research project as a scientist involved collecting live, radioactive alligators. I have been attacked by animals as diverse as: Portuguese Man-o-war, Roseate Spoonbill, Southern Stingray, Rock Rattlesnake, Coatimundi. My favorite animal is the Mantis Shrimp.</p>\\n\\n<p>I currently own: 4 dogs and 2 cats.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>WHAT AM I DOING AT RIOT? WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT NEXT YEAR?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I joined Riot in 2013 and I am now the game design director for League. I describe my job as a combination of three things: I&#039;m ultimately accountable for the design quality of League, I work with the other leads to determine long-term strategy and our big bets for the next year, and I manage the design department. I work a lot on projects such as our Season 2016 plan. I help answer things such as what kinds of champions should we be making, what do we want the pace of the game to be, and what new features does League need.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>The best kinds of questions to hit me with are about our design philosophy or <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/dev-blog-design-values-league-legends\">core design values</a>. The kinds of questions I can best answer are &quot;Would Riot ever consider this Big New Feature?&quot; &ldquo;Where do you see League in 5 years?&rdquo; &quot;How does Riot balance for such a wide range of skills?&quot; &quot;How much counterplay is acceptable?&quot; &quot;What were Riot&rsquo;s goals with preseason?&quot; &quot;Is League too snowbally?&quot; &quot;Does Riot make too much change to the game?&quot; &quot;How many champions can League support?&quot; I don&#039;t directly balance champions or design new items. I&#039;m fine if you blame me for bad balance, but if you want to know our thoughts on a particular change or the state of a champion, you&#039;re better off asking the Rioters who are working directly on them.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM ME?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>If you know anything about me, you hopefully know that I strive to be really transparent with players and that I have very thick skin.

Whether the mastery was overpowered or not wasn&#x27;t really that much of a factor when deciding to remove it honestly - SoA wasn&#x27;t really fitting the goals we initially set out for when we changed to the keystone mastery system.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>A big reason other champions wanted SoA was the fact it was such generalist power. Health is almost always a good thing to have in league of legends, regardless of what champion you are (especially as a jungler). Resolve though as a tree is intended to serve specific playstyles of champion classes and subclasses (Juggernauts, Wardens, Vanguards aka tanky champions), especially when you get down to the bottom three keystones themselves. </p>\\n  \\n  <p>In removing SoA we want to sharpen the options available at the keystone level such that they feel more attached to what you&#x27;re planning to do when you take them. In this case, we removed the super generalist health increase and put in something aimed at giving Vanguard initiators and tanky building Divers to choose and feel good about.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>Also just to add, SoA was boring. We wanted to replace it with something more fun.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>interesting that you mention juggernauts.</p>\\n\\n<p>did you realize that the resolve tree has become so terrible for them, that a lot of them arent even going into the mastery tree anymore? there is a severe lack of scaling defensive masteries right now, while cunning and ferocity bring a lot of % damage amplification masteries.</p>\\n\\n<p>ive seen nasus mains usually go into cunning fo stormraiders right now. </p>\\n\\n<p>ive seen some of the few above plat garen mains left this season also go for stormraiders. </p>\\n\\n<p>last time i checked, illaoi goes for dft. her highest win % build doesnt have a single point in resolve.</p>\\n\\n<p>voli goes for fervor, which is no surprise.</p>\\n\\n<p>morde goes for stormraider.</p>\\n\\n<p>last time i checked the new yorick goes for dft.</p>\\n\\n<p>the only juggernaut who actually still goes into resolve for grasp seems to be darius right now.</p>\\n\\n<p>removing strength of the ages instead of giving it some slight improvements for laners feels like it just removes another option for this class and another incentive to even consider the tree, since juggernauts dont even have the form of cc needed to trigger the new keystone.</p>\\n\\n<p>Critmaster Garen</p>\\n',\n",

I would probably argue that some of those cases the mastery they moved to naturally fit their playstyle very well and give them something they actually needed (like Nasus wanting more maneuverability and sticking power) and those champions can get away with less tankiness since Juggernauts have a mixed identity between tankiness and damage. </p>\\n\\n<p>For the rest, I think tuning is a big point here. Many of those you listed felt fine using Grasp when it was stronger. It could be that Grasp needs a buff or the others they are using are too strong. (Not saying that either of those statements are true or false.)

In my opinion, the item system in League can&#x27;t be held hostage to rulebreakers or it will fail to properly serve the majority of champions - it&#x27;s better to fix itemization for the majority of the cast and deal with outliers than to allow outliers to dictate game-warping itemization.

They make champions like Skarner deal immense damage while also being tankier than most dedicated tanks such as Sejuani, Gragas, Amumu etc. I&#039;m OK with this because at least juggernauts don&#039;t have true gap closers. However, it still seems strange that tank items like FH not only provide worse stats but also worse late game scaling.</p>\\n\\n<p>If Riot thinks FH is too strong, then why not just increase the cost but keep the stats the same? Tanks already have difficulty farming quickly or getting kills to snowball so why make them worse even in the best late game scenario? Much of their damage is % health based so isn&#039;t even that high except against other tanks. Furthermore, all tank items even before these changes fell off  late game compared to damage oriented champs simply because 35% of their stats were ignored due to LW &amp; VS. </p>\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, Skarner can nearly 1-shot whoever he ults. as fast as I snap my fingers. It just seems like with the Cinderhulk changes and significant armor nerfs, tanks are back to where they were before Season 5. It&#039;s already not the most rewarding class and requires more of a team-focused mindset.

We've been looking at a series of sub groups with that larger fighter group as a result as follows:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Juggernauts - Immobile, tough, build one to two offensive items on average (e.g. Nasus or Garen)</li>\\n<li>Divers - Pretty mobile, and really good at getting onto specific targets they want to kill, builds a little bit more offensively than juggernauts (e.g. Irelia or Xin Zhao)</li>\\n<li>Light fighters (need a better name for this group - Highly mobile, builds almost entirely offense, often good at killing multiple targets, usually squishy with windowed defense of evasieness (e.g. Trynd or Fiora).</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Biggest contrast between tanks and juggernauts is in what each group is trying do. Tanks are generally trying to initiate or peel more, kill by themselves less.

Before that I was a lead designer on Age of Empires for 10 years. Before that, I was an oceanographer, which is where the crustacean avatar came from. I was an army brat who lived lots of places, but I identify most as a Texan.</p>\\n\\n<p>My favorite game of all time is Dungeons and Dragons. I have played for 30 years, in all 5 editions.  For video games, I&rsquo;ll just list broad families of games that I love and that have influenced me: XCOM, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, Chrono Trigger, Diablo, Doom, Civilization, Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls, Baldur&rsquo;s Gate, Planescape: Torment, Mass Effect, Metroid, Grand Theft Auto, and Okami. Outside of games, I enjoy travel, reading about history and science, and being outdoors. My last research project as a scientist involved collecting live, radioactive alligators. I have been attacked by animals as diverse as: Portuguese Man-o-war, Roseate Spoonbill, Southern Stingray, Rock Rattlesnake, Coatimundi. My favorite animal is the Mantis Shrimp.</p>\\n\\n<p>I currently own: 4 dogs and 2 cats.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>WHAT AM I DOING AT RIOT? WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT NEXT YEAR?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I joined Riot in 2013 and I am now the game design director for League. I describe my job as a combination of three things: I&#039;m ultimately accountable for the design quality of League, I work with the other leads to determine long-term strategy and our big bets for the next year, and I manage the design department. I work a lot on projects such as our Season 2016 plan. I help answer things such as what kinds of champions should we be making, what do we want the pace of the game to be, and what new features does League need.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>The best kinds of questions to hit me with are about our design philosophy or <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/dev-blog-design-values-league-legends\">core design values</a>. The kinds of questions I can best answer are &quot;Would Riot ever consider this Big New Feature?&quot; &ldquo;Where do you see League in 5 years?&rdquo; &quot;How does Riot balance for such a wide range of skills?&quot; &quot;How much counterplay is acceptable?&quot; &quot;What were Riot&rsquo;s goals with preseason?&quot; &quot;Is League too snowbally?&quot; &quot;Does Riot make too much change to the game?&quot; &quot;How many champions can League support?&quot; I don&#039;t directly balance champions or design new items. I&#039;m fine if you blame me for bad balance, but if you want to know our thoughts on a particular change or the state of a champion, you&#039;re better off asking the Rioters who are working directly on them.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM ME?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>If you know anything about me, you hopefully know that I strive to be really transparent with players and that I have very thick skin.

Whether the mastery was overpowered or not wasn&#x27;t really that much of a factor when deciding to remove it honestly - SoA wasn&#x27;t really fitting the goals we initially set out for when we changed to the keystone mastery system.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>A big reason other champions wanted SoA was the fact it was such generalist power. Health is almost always a good thing to have in league of legends, regardless of what champion you are (especially as a jungler). Resolve though as a tree is intended to serve specific playstyles of champion classes and subclasses (Juggernauts, Wardens, Vanguards aka tanky champions), especially when you get down to the bottom three keystones themselves. </p>\\n  \\n  <p>In removing SoA we want to sharpen the options available at the keystone level such that they feel more attached to what you&#x27;re planning to do when you take them. In this case, we removed the super generalist health increase and put in something aimed at giving Vanguard initiators and tanky building Divers to choose and feel good about.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>Also just to add, SoA was boring. We wanted to replace it with something more fun.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>interesting that you mention juggernauts.</p>\\n\\n<p>did you realize that the resolve tree has become so terrible for them, that a lot of them arent even going into the mastery tree anymore? there is a severe lack of scaling defensive masteries right now, while cunning and ferocity bring a lot of % damage amplification masteries.</p>\\n\\n<p>ive seen nasus mains usually go into cunning fo stormraiders right now. </p>\\n\\n<p>ive seen some of the few above plat garen mains left this season also go for stormraiders. </p>\\n\\n<p>last time i checked, illaoi goes for dft. her highest win % build doesnt have a single point in resolve.</p>\\n\\n<p>voli goes for fervor, which is no surprise.</p>\\n\\n<p>morde goes for stormraider.</p>\\n\\n<p>last time i checked the new yorick goes for dft.</p>\\n\\n<p>the only juggernaut who actually still goes into resolve for grasp seems to be darius right now.</p>\\n\\n<p>removing strength of the ages instead of giving it some slight improvements for laners feels like it just removes another option for this class and another incentive to even consider the tree, since juggernauts dont even have the form of cc needed to trigger the new keystone.</p>\\n\\n<p>Critmaster Garen</p>\\n',\n",

I would probably argue that some of those cases the mastery they moved to naturally fit their playstyle very well and give them something they actually needed (like Nasus wanting more maneuverability and sticking power) and those champions can get away with less tankiness since Juggernauts have a mixed identity between tankiness and damage. </p>\\n\\n<p>For the rest, I think tuning is a big point here. Many of those you listed felt fine using Grasp when it was stronger. It could be that Grasp needs a buff or the others they are using are too strong. (Not saying that either of those statements are true or false.)

       "   'parent_content': '<p>Hey there Rep. Thanks for taking time to chit-chat! There were a few reasons I wanted to touch on Voli-</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>1.) He\\'s forgotten most of the time. Most people really don\\'t know about Volibear or gloss over him. The simplistic kit really doesn\\'t do anything in his favor either.</p></li>\\n<li><p>2.) Volibear has IMMENSE potential. character-and-kit-wise Unlike other ursine characters (Ursa, Druids of the Claw, etc) who are often portrayed as hulking brutes but rather stupid outside of \"NATURE!\", Volibear is not only wise but an advisor to the Winter\\'s claw. He\\'s a warrior but he\\'s patient, intelligent and probably the smartest in Sejuani\\'s little clique.</p></li>\\n<li><p>3.) I made this thread mostly because when people talk about champions in need of updates or reworks, you see the same problem cases brought up over-and-over. Taric has pizza feet. Poppy is a monster. Yorick is a pile of trash. Evelynn has no clear identity, etc. While, as you said, Volibear isn\\'t an immediate pressing concern, he still has problems. IMO it\\'s important to shine light on guys who may not be a direct problem but could still need some love.</p></li>\\n<li><p>4.) He needs a real name. Someone gave up on naming this guy halfway through. </p></li>\\n<li><p>5.) Juggernaut/Tanks are coming back in a major way. I feel it was important to bring up one of the less spoken-off Juggertank characters. You see stuff talked about for Shyvana, Olaf, Garen, Darius, etc but poor old Volibear is clawing at the windows hoping for someone to let him inside.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>CaptainMårvelous</p>\\n',\n",

Unfortunately, none of it ever really stuck, and we ultimately decided that the character fantasy of getting on all fours and barreling past everyone was probably better served by changes that didn't restrict his ability to do that. A lot of the Juggernauts to significant hits to their mobility, or at least made that mobility situational, and we thought taking that from Volibear would mean damaging some of the most iconic stuff about him.</p>\\n\\n<p>Hopefully when we get to placing him and working on him, we can find a really cool execution of the wise thunder bear, but it'll probably be some time.</p>\\n\",\n",
