Riot Scruffy here, and I’m taking over for the Quick Gameplay Thoughts dev blog every other week. As Lead Gameplay Designer I manage the design teams that work on Champions, Game Balance, Items, the SR Map, Runes, Matchmaking, and Ranked. I plan to bring you all some updates and previews of upcoming work and go deeper into our reasoning and goals with the work that we do. Everything we add, change, and remove from LoL is done for a reason and we hope that our work makes the game better every patch. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Balance Strategy Refresh</strong>\\nThis won’t be news to many of you, but I thought it would be good to do a quick refresh of our balance strategy. The reality of League of Legends is that the game played at different levels of skill is like an entirely different game in terms of which champions and strategies are strong or weak. With this in mind, it’s impossible to have all 148 champions balanced at every level of play. </p>\\n\\n<p>Our approach is to slice the game into 4 different skill segments where we think balance is meaningfully different:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Normal (Iron - Gold)</li>\\n<li>Skilled (Plat - Master)</li>\\n<li>Elite (Grandmaster-Challenger)</li>\\n<li>Professional </li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>And then ensure that every champ is:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Viable in at least one segment</li>\\n<li>Overpowered in no skill segments</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The core reasoning behind this is that we think that an overpowered champion can suppress the viability and richness of the entire game meta, so we want to protect players of all skill levels from this unbalanced game state. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Jungle Followup</strong>\\nWith enough time to see the results on the preseason jungle changes, we’re seeing some goals were achieved and some not. </p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Small nerfs - the jungle XP and gold are nerfed, but it’s looking like it’s a bit too hard in particular on farming and later game junglers.</li>\\n<li>Pathing is more balanced - this goal was definitely achieved, not all paths are perfectly balanced with each other but we’re much closer here than we were in season 9</li>\\n<li>Less early ganks more farm - this goal was not achieved, we’re seeing roughly the same amount of early ganking as season 9</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The plan - we’re looking to buff up jungle XP slightly and skew towards incentives to farm over gank</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Buffing jungle XP per min for minutes 4-18 and spreading it across the less targeted camps that are often skipped by gank heavy junglers</li>\\n<li>Pushing back the minion farm penalty removal to further nerf funnel strategies (which are rare but extremely strong)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><strong>Sett Release Retro</strong>\\nNow that Sett has been out for two weeks, I wanted to share some thoughts on how we think his gameplay turned out. Some of the long term effects of hit kit can’t really be known for sure at this point, but I still wanted to share my early thoughts.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Low complexity - Sett is a wonderful demonstration of how even in 2020, simple designs can be both satisfying and skillful. We want to do much more of this in the future where we focus on “quality over quantity” in our champ kits. </li>\\n<li>Unique but not game changing - Sett brings a few pretty exciting new ideas to the table like damage reflect and turning the enemy tank into a nuke. He isn’t redefining what a champion in LoL can be, but for his goals as an accessible top lane juggernaut, I think he’s on target. </li>\\n<li>Balance - Sett’s winrate has climbed over his first two weeks of play and he’s appearing to be a be viable as a top and jungle currently. It’s possible that he may need some slight nerfs in the future, but he doesn’t seem to be significantly OP today. </li>\\n<li>Clear weaknesses - Another success worth calling out is that Sett is powerful, but he provides enemies a clear opportunity for counterplay. </li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><strong>Upcoming balance changes for 10.3:</strong>\\n<strong>Akali</strong> - Many of you already saw the Akali changes on PBE. Akali is dominating both pro and elite level play, but she’s not nearly as OP for skilled and normal. With that in mind we’re trying to reduce the amount of control she has over choosing when to fight, which is a core reason why she is such a strong pick at the top tier of play. The upside here is that if these mechanics changes make her a more counterable champion at the top levels of play, we can give her some more conventional buffs to allow her to be viable in regular play. After testing the initial changes, we’re making a few changes:\\nMoving away from “CC reveals her during W stealth” as it was making the experience unreliable in a confusing way and adding inconsistency to our stealth rules\\nCutting R2 speed decrease - this wasn’t getting us a lot of movement for how bad it felt\\nKeeping R1 as targeted as it’s effectively lowering both her escape tools and her super long range pick potential \\nExploring a few other alternatives like early ranks of Q energy cost being higher to reduce her lane trade and push power</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Yuumi buffs</strong> - The Yuumi changes in patch 9.24 have left her with significant new weaknesses that allow us to give her a decent buff. The tactic we’re exploring right now is to buff Q rankups so that Q max is a viable build (letting her have an active playstyle instead of only E max build) </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Aphelios</strong> - We’re adding a max range on caibrum marks. We intend to keep it as a very long range poke effect, but bring it in line with other similar mechanics like Caitlyn or Xerath. Frankly, cross map sniping is not interactive or interesting gameplay, so we’re removing it. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Senna</strong> - we want to shift a bit of power out of Markswoman position Senna to Support Senna. This probably means we’ll be tuning soul drops for when you get the minion kill vs when your ally does. </p>\\n\\n<p>These are just a few of the changes in for 10.3 - expect more info next week about the full patch. </p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks again everyone for playing. I’m excited to be making more posts like this about our design process and thinking.

A lot of people have time on holiday in December but, because we start the ranked season early in the new year, they can't start their ranked climb or play in as competitive a queue. We did try starting a ranked season in December a few years back to see if that was a better overall experience. Our conclusion was that it wasn't worth the trade offs though unfortunately. The gap between preseason going out and ranked turning on being so short means there's not enough time for followup on the preseason changes, leading to a significantly less stable game state for the early parts of the season. That's particularly problematic since there's also a patch at the end of the year that's live for longer than normal (around 4 weeks usually instead of the usual 2), so any issues take longer to get addressed as well. </p>\\n\\n<p>http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png</p>\\n\", 'title': 'Quick Gameplay Thoughts: October 11'} 63706406301481000\n",

The next major step are some upcoming tests this coming weekend in BR and LATAM. Those are focused on testing two things primarily:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Tier based phasing.

Some are just straight power (he's on the weak side now as expected since we hit him with some meaningful nerfs). Wanted to talk through some of the changes that might benefit from more context though:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>We testing moving his shield from his W to his E. Goal there is to make so that if Urgot wants to trade using his shield he has to put both of his defensive tools (dash as well) on CD. That increased risk to his trading then means we can probably give him power in other regards.</li>\\n<li>We're increasing his ult range noticeably. In retrospect we were potentially overly cautious on the range restriction originally, especially given it's easy to block or miss. </li>\\n<li>We're making AD builds less sub optimal, with the aim of opening up his itemization a bit more. Goal is still to have him as a juggernaut who tends to want to build fairly tanky. Would like to narrow the gap in effectiveness between AD and tankier builds though.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />\\n<strong>We're looking for a few associate designers</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>More details in this Twitter thread in case it's of interest and you haven't already seen it:</p>\\n\\n<p>https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler/status/1102988737175216128</p>\\n\\n<p>TLDR - we've got a few open spots right now for associate game designers.

Another is making her upgrades a bit harder to unlock, given the original intent wasn&#039;t that she&#039;d unlock all 3 this reliably.  </li>\\n<li>Tank Pyke nerf - While keeping AD Pyke around its current power level. Potentially involves some degree of kit effect changes (e.g. modifying the HP -&gt; AD effect on his passive plus additional scaling changes?)</li>\\n<li>Corki buff - Didn&#039;t make it into 8.20, aiming to have it in 8.21 as a result.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />\\n<strong>OMW Ping improvements in 8.21</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>We should also have some improvements to the OMW pings in 8.21. The big change is that the sound of the pings themselves will now communicate a couple of extra pieces of info:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Processing applied to the sound will represent distance between the user of the ping and the pinged location. The further that distance, the more echo there&#039;ll be. Basically it&#039;s a representation of how long it&#039;ll take the pinging player to get there.</li>\\n<li>The further the ping is from the listening player the quieter the ping will be played. If someone&#039;s pinging that they&#039;re on the way to your lane, you&#039;ll hear a loud ping. If they&#039;re pinging they&#039;re on their way to the other side of the map, it&#039;ll be comparatively quiet. </li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>We&#039;ll also be putting a chat notification of the OMW ping being used back in team chat. Looks like that got accidentally broken at some point when this approach was being developed. </p>\\n\\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />\\n<strong>Why we don&#039;t use adaptive effects in game</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Since we added both adaptive damage and adaptive stats to the pre-game with Runes the question&#039;s naturally been raised as to why we&#039;re not using them in game as well. Things like why not have items just grant Adaptive AP/AD so more champs can use them, or having damage on champ abilities or from items change types to be more optimal all the time. Some thoughts on why we haven&#039;t been doing that below.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Adaptive Damage</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>By which we mean damage that can change its type. Easy example being Arcane Comet, which deals magic damage when you&#039;re building AP and physical damage when you&#039;re building AD. With Runes we were almost always aiming to design effects that could be  added on to any damage pattern. Offering the damage type that would make sense with the sort of pen you were likely to build was more appropriate as a result. That also means it&#039;s easier to pick defensive options against a specific champion, since their pregame damage contributions will generally be matching their kit damage type.</p>\\n\\n<p>For in game effects by contrast our concern is that adaptive damage makes it much harder to predict what sort of damage you&#039;ll be facing and therefore purchase/play against it. LoL&#039;s got a lot of champ abilities and other damage sources already to understand/track, so making it so you also need to assess someone&#039;s build all the time to understand whether an ability has flipped damage type is something we generally want to avoid. Possible we might make the occasional exception, especially if it&#039;s a strong fit with a champion&#039;s theme and really well communicated through art/audio etc, but even then would expect it to be a rare thing if done at all.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Adaptive Stats on items etc (or abilities that scale with either stat)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>As in stats that just give you whichever you scale best with of AP/AD/whatever. Again with Runes we wanted things to be really open, particularly to avoid having to make additional runes that were basically just duplicates with different scaling. With items by contrast there are quite a lot of cases where limiting the pool of users can be really important, particularly from a game health perspective. Which stats an item offers is a really good way to skew its value towards different users it&#039;s intended to serve well (e.g. pushing Zhonya&#039;s towards primarily mages and other heavy AP users, or skewing Black Cleaver towards health so we can keep it in a good spot for juggernauts and other tankier fighters). Additionally items changing which stats they offer also contributes to difficulty understanding and reacting to enemy damage output, especially if it flips back and forth during the game. We&#039;ve been very hesitant about adaptive stats in game as a result, given the degree to which that would privilege offense over defense, unless making defensive stats adaptive as well. There are some cases where it might be a useful tool (e.g. opening up the Spellthief&#039;s line to AD users).

WE ARE WORKING TO FIND A FIX.</strong></p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<p><em>*/!\\\\ GET HYPED SUMMONERS /!*</em></p>\\n\\n<p>This will be the central PBE feedback thread for Nexus Blitz, our new experimental game mode, before it goes to live for a multi-patch alpha test (...yes, we&#039;re in a beta of an alpha). If you haven&#039;t read it yet, go to the<a href=\"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/yKk22n3O-experimental-modes-nexus-blitz\"> [[dev corner thread here]]</a> for the high-level context on experimental modes and Nexus Blitz! This thread&#039;s for us to talk details.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>REMINDER:</strong> Nexus Blitz is basically in &quot;early access&quot; right now, so it&#039;s kinda rough and unpolished. We&#039;ll be AGGRESSIVELY PATCHING everything from champ balance to the map itself it order to make the experience better over time, both here on PBE and when we begin the alpha on live. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s different?</strong></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p><strong>A New Map</strong> - Nexus Blitz is played on a small map that encourages murdering each other. A single lane splits into 2 in the middle, and the top of the map is a jungle with camps and buffs to fight over.</p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>Duo Jungle</strong> - Each team will be required to have two junglers who will work together to secure camps and objectives. Jungle XP and Gold is tuned so that it is advantageous to split it between two people. No need to funnel (we hope).</p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>Short Game Time</strong> - Games of Nexus Blitz average 13-15 minutes, and are guaranteed to end by 20. How can we guarantee that? You&#039;ll see.</p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>Events &amp; Rewards</strong> - Events are map-wide murder-encouraging objectives that bestow glorious rewards on the victors. Do you like payloads and pushing? We got that. Have a thing for circles? Same. LOOT TEEMO!?!?!?!? Kill it with fire. Just don&rsquo;t INT yourself with the Cannonpult. We&rsquo;re just getting started on these things and hope to add more events and rewards as the mode is developed. </p></li>\\n<li><strong>On-Fire</strong> - Nexus Blitz rewards bloodthirsty players who\\nmanage to get kills and stay alive by lighting them On-Fire, granting tons of adaptive stats, CDR, and mana regen. Watch out though, you&rsquo;ll be easier to kill while On-Fire and grant a large bounty to those who manage to shut you down. It&rsquo;s lit fam.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Hit the PBE and try things out! We&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback. Tell us about the things you find enjoyable (or awful). What are things that would make you stop playing (or want to play more)? We&rsquo;ve got a long way to go and are ready to make changes. Thanks!</p>\\n\\n<h2>Below are more detailed descriptions of the map specific mechanics as well as any patches we release over the course of the PBE</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Updates will go here over the course of our PBE stay!</h2>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p><strong>STARTING ITEMS</strong></p>\\n  \\n  <ul>\\n  <li><p>Only 1 starter item can be purchased. Doran&rsquo;s, jungle, and support items all count as starter items.</p></li>\\n  <li><p>The sustain aspects of the Doran&rsquo;s items have been significantly buffed (Lifesteal, mana regen, health regen)</p></li>\\n  <li><p>Added a new Doran&rsquo;s item for Enchanters who want to last hit (Doran&rsquo;s Lost Idol).</p></li>\\n  </ul>\\n  \\n  <p>-----Support items have been changed-----\\n  *  Supports can buy Heart of Targon (Relic Shield) or Philosopher&#039;s Medallion (Ancient Coin). Spellthief&rsquo;s line has been removed.</p>\\n  \\n  <ul>\\n  <li><p>These items are stronger than their SR counterparts but do not upgrade into anything.</p></li>\\n  <li><p>Support item quests are gone, as is sightstone.</p></li>\\n  <li>Control wards have been removed</li>\\n  </ul>\\n  \\n  <p><strong>JUNGLE</strong>\\n  *  There&rsquo;s a turret in the enemy jungle. It&rsquo;s invincible. Don&rsquo;t try to kill it. You&rsquo;ll die. Your friends will laugh at you.\\n  *  Jungle camps taken with more than one champion grant 150% XP and Gold split between the champions taking it (compared to 100% XP and Gold if taken alone)\\n  -------Jungle items have been simplified---------\\n  *  All builds start with &ldquo;Pridestalker&rsquo;s Blade,&quot; a combination of Hunter&rsquo;s Machete and Talisman, which then can be upgraded with an enchant.\\n  *  Upgrading to the Enchant grants Chilling Smite along with the normal bonuses.\\n  *  &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; XP and Gold mechanics have been removed.\\n  *  Red and Blue buff are now located centrally and are much stronger. Taking a buff camp gives a supercharged version of the buff to the 2 nearest champions on the team who last hit it.\\n  *  Rift Herald is stronger, granting Baron Buff AND Rift Herald for 2 minutes to the team who takes it.\\n  *  Baron Buff only buffs minions, it does not give AP and AD.</p>\\n  \\n  <p><strong>ON-FIRE</strong>\\n  *  Getting X kills or assists without dying lights you On-Fire.\\n  -----On-Fire stats-------\\n  *  20% Attack Speed\\n  *  20-200 Adaptive force (based on level)\\n  *  TONS of CDR (Does not count towards the CDR cap)\\n  *  20 mana/energy per second\\n  *  25% increased damage taken\\n  *  On-Fire has no maximum duration, but is lost when killed and grants 800+ gold to your killer and 200+ gold to the each other champion on the killer&rsquo;s team</p>\\n  \\n  <p><strong>EVENTS &amp; REWARDS</strong>\\n  *  A random event happens every few minutes (average 2-3 per game)\\n  *  Winning an event grants the victors a random reward\\n  *  Many events have additional bonuses on top of the reward granted to the winner (like gold for doing a thing)\\n  *  The final event happens at 18 minutes. It is not random. Its reward is arguably the best in the game.</p>\\n  \\n  <p><strong>GOLD SHARING</strong>\\n  *  All minion deaths (regardless of last hit) and monster kills share ~30% of the total gold value to every champion on the team. (Not XP, though.)  As an example. If a cannon minion is worth 100g, everyone on your team gets 30g when it dies.\\n  *  Last hitters (or nearby allies in the case of jungle camps) still get the full gold (and XP) value.  So if you kill a 100g cannon minion you will get 100g and the rest of your team will get 30g\\n  *  Gold from champion kills and assists is NOT globally shared</p>\\n  \\n  <p><strong>NEW (old) ITEMS</strong>\\n  A number of fan favorite items are returning for a second grasp at life in Nexus Blitz\\n  *  Wriggle&rsquo;s Lantern\\n  *  Ghost Walkers\\n  *  Spectral Cutlass\\n  *  Bloodletter&#039;s Veil\\n  *  Deathfire Grasp\\n  *  Spear of Shojin\\n  *  Atma&rsquo;s Reckoning\\n  *  Force of Nature\\n  *  (Heart of Gold and Philosopher&#039;s Stone have spiritually returned&mdash;see Starting items above.)</p>\\n  \\n  <p><strong>GLOBAL MAP AURA</strong>\\n  * +30% Summoner Spell CDR\\n  * +30% bonus Mana Regen at level 1</p>\\n  \\n  <p><strong>SURRENDER</strong>\\n  * Games can be surrendered with a 4 -1 vote after the 8 minute mark.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p><strong>RUNES REFORGED</strong>\\n  Most time based runes (Like Magical Footwear and Gathering Storm) have been rebalanced for the mode.

We are greatly reducing the local and global gold that towers give.  Overall, we feel that the map control afforded by simply downing a tower in NB is powerful enough without also giving the team that takes it 3 kills worth of gold.\\nB.

Riot Scruffy here, and I’m taking over for the Quick Gameplay Thoughts dev blog every other week. As Lead Gameplay Designer I manage the design teams that work on Champions, Game Balance, Items, the SR Map, Runes, Matchmaking, and Ranked. I plan to bring you all some updates and previews of upcoming work and go deeper into our reasoning and goals with the work that we do. Everything we add, change, and remove from LoL is done for a reason and we hope that our work makes the game better every patch. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Balance Strategy Refresh</strong>\\nThis won’t be news to many of you, but I thought it would be good to do a quick refresh of our balance strategy. The reality of League of Legends is that the game played at different levels of skill is like an entirely different game in terms of which champions and strategies are strong or weak. With this in mind, it’s impossible to have all 148 champions balanced at every level of play. </p>\\n\\n<p>Our approach is to slice the game into 4 different skill segments where we think balance is meaningfully different:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Normal (Iron - Gold)</li>\\n<li>Skilled (Plat - Master)</li>\\n<li>Elite (Grandmaster-Challenger)</li>\\n<li>Professional </li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>And then ensure that every champ is:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Viable in at least one segment</li>\\n<li>Overpowered in no skill segments</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The core reasoning behind this is that we think that an overpowered champion can suppress the viability and richness of the entire game meta, so we want to protect players of all skill levels from this unbalanced game state. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Jungle Followup</strong>\\nWith enough time to see the results on the preseason jungle changes, we’re seeing some goals were achieved and some not. </p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Small nerfs - the jungle XP and gold are nerfed, but it’s looking like it’s a bit too hard in particular on farming and later game junglers.</li>\\n<li>Pathing is more balanced - this goal was definitely achieved, not all paths are perfectly balanced with each other but we’re much closer here than we were in season 9</li>\\n<li>Less early ganks more farm - this goal was not achieved, we’re seeing roughly the same amount of early ganking as season 9</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The plan - we’re looking to buff up jungle XP slightly and skew towards incentives to farm over gank</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Buffing jungle XP per min for minutes 4-18 and spreading it across the less targeted camps that are often skipped by gank heavy junglers</li>\\n<li>Pushing back the minion farm penalty removal to further nerf funnel strategies (which are rare but extremely strong)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><strong>Sett Release Retro</strong>\\nNow that Sett has been out for two weeks, I wanted to share some thoughts on how we think his gameplay turned out. Some of the long term effects of hit kit can’t really be known for sure at this point, but I still wanted to share my early thoughts.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Low complexity - Sett is a wonderful demonstration of how even in 2020, simple designs can be both satisfying and skillful. We want to do much more of this in the future where we focus on “quality over quantity” in our champ kits. </li>\\n<li>Unique but not game changing - Sett brings a few pretty exciting new ideas to the table like damage reflect and turning the enemy tank into a nuke. He isn’t redefining what a champion in LoL can be, but for his goals as an accessible top lane juggernaut, I think he’s on target. </li>\\n<li>Balance - Sett’s winrate has climbed over his first two weeks of play and he’s appearing to be a be viable as a top and jungle currently. It’s possible that he may need some slight nerfs in the future, but he doesn’t seem to be significantly OP today. </li>\\n<li>Clear weaknesses - Another success worth calling out is that Sett is powerful, but he provides enemies a clear opportunity for counterplay. </li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><strong>Upcoming balance changes for 10.3:</strong>\\n<strong>Akali</strong> - Many of you already saw the Akali changes on PBE. Akali is dominating both pro and elite level play, but she’s not nearly as OP for skilled and normal. With that in mind we’re trying to reduce the amount of control she has over choosing when to fight, which is a core reason why she is such a strong pick at the top tier of play. The upside here is that if these mechanics changes make her a more counterable champion at the top levels of play, we can give her some more conventional buffs to allow her to be viable in regular play. After testing the initial changes, we’re making a few changes:\\nMoving away from “CC reveals her during W stealth” as it was making the experience unreliable in a confusing way and adding inconsistency to our stealth rules\\nCutting R2 speed decrease - this wasn’t getting us a lot of movement for how bad it felt\\nKeeping R1 as targeted as it’s effectively lowering both her escape tools and her super long range pick potential \\nExploring a few other alternatives like early ranks of Q energy cost being higher to reduce her lane trade and push power</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Yuumi buffs</strong> - The Yuumi changes in patch 9.24 have left her with significant new weaknesses that allow us to give her a decent buff. The tactic we’re exploring right now is to buff Q rankups so that Q max is a viable build (letting her have an active playstyle instead of only E max build) </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Aphelios</strong> - We’re adding a max range on caibrum marks. We intend to keep it as a very long range poke effect, but bring it in line with other similar mechanics like Caitlyn or Xerath. Frankly, cross map sniping is not interactive or interesting gameplay, so we’re removing it. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Senna</strong> - we want to shift a bit of power out of Markswoman position Senna to Support Senna. This probably means we’ll be tuning soul drops for when you get the minion kill vs when your ally does. </p>\\n\\n<p>These are just a few of the changes in for 10.3 - expect more info next week about the full patch. </p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks again everyone for playing. I’m excited to be making more posts like this about our design process and thinking.

I&rsquo;m a totally obsessed video gamer (in the best possible way), and games like DOTA, WoW, LoL, and pretty much anything with the Star Wars brand have occupied the best years of my life. </p>\\n\\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been a few places around the game industry before Riot, most notably I worked at Treyarch on Black Ops 2 right before I joined. They taught me some great stuff about how to make everything feel OP, and how to really sell a fantasy. </p>\\n\\n<p>I currently own: 1 cats.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>WHAT AM I DOING AT RIOT?</strong>\\nThere&rsquo;s kinda two sections here for me, the past and the future:</p>\\n\\n<p>The past (and present): I&rsquo;m the Lead Designer of the Champion Update team, which has worked on many of your favorites (and unfavorites I&rsquo;m sure) like Sion, Poppy, Gangplank, Fiora, Juggernauts, Marksmen updates and many more. I have a TON of history with this team, having helped build it up from the ground when I started at Riot almost 3 years ago until now. </p>\\n\\n<p>The future: I&rsquo;m going to be moving over to be Lead Designer of the Champion team. A new set of challenges and a really talented new group of people there is really exciting. Building up the next generation of new champions and hopefully surprising you all with some great new innovations is my goal. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT?</strong>\\nChamp-Up has grown and changed so so much over these past years, and I can talk about so many things. &ldquo;Why did we start doing group updates like Juggernaut/Marksmen?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do we decide how much to preserve or redo on a champ-up like Poppy?&rdquo; </p>\\n\\n<p>Or even less specific stuff that is more related to our champion/game design philosophy like: &ldquo;How have we evolved our strategy for making interactive gameplay without overusing skillshots?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do we build up a new champion from concept to completion?&rdquo; &ldquo;How did we go about categorizing our champions into archetypes so that we could better understand them (see juggernauts)?&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p>I&rsquo;d also like to bridge the gap - when I can - of how our general game design practice can carry over into good character mechanic design and vice versa. It might be cool to do some topics that explore how to apply our champ design principle to other systems or even games altogether. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM ME?</strong>\\nAnything about Champ design or Champion updates is definitely on the table for me. Get creative, I&rsquo;m open to whatever cool topics you all would like to talk about.</p>\\n', 'title': '[INTRO] Mark “RiotScruffy” Yetter - Lead Game Designer, Champions'} 63585379195814000\n",

Around three years ago, we decided to really try our hand at it. The smart thing to do would have been to reach out to an established tabletop company that we know does this well, but we really wanted to take a full swing ourselves to see if we could come up with a game that made sense for League players. We&rsquo;re very fortunate to have a lot of freedom to pivot when necessary, which is a rare luxury that we wanted to take advantage of. Going with a company that has done this before would have saved us a bunch of headaches along the way, but we wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to keep asking &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t a board game do this?&rdquo; at every step, and I believe (and hope!) that the game is better off for it. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>*EUREKA!\\n*</em>\\nRiot happened to have an accomplished board game designer (Stone Librande), who frequently came up with new ideas for games. One of the ones we looked at had a compelling programming mechanic that we wanted to pursue. A lot of the game has obviously changed since that point, but that kernel was the center that the rest of the game was built around. </p>\\n\\n<p>The next step was to match a League theme to those mechanics. The story of MvM is within the League universe, so we had a lot of freedom to play with which champions would be involved and what we could put them through. With programming, it made sense to look at robots, and an early iteration featured Blitzcrank and Orianna. But the mechs are difficult to control, and they run into a lot of funny situations that way, and it didn&rsquo;t feel right that Ori or Blitz couldn&rsquo;t control themselves well. Then we thought of Rumble, who is easier to see slipping around on oil slicks, and we started to build the thematic aspects of the game from there. We wanted more yordles in the game but wanted to keep the mechs, so we had Rumble open up a mech-piloting school, and his personality helped us shape a story that we could tie the other four into. Once we had that theme, building the game felt much more organic; the theme and mechanics started to inform each other in ways that felt right, and progress followed.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>*THE MINIONS GO MARCHING ONE BY ONE\\n*</em>\\nWe spent the year working on it, figuring out artwork and models and any other kind of forward progress we could find, and landed on something that I thought felt pretty good. I&rsquo;m a huge board game nerd, so I wanted to reach out to some of the reviewers and communities that I love: BoardGameGeek, Geek &amp; Sundry, Shut Up &amp; Sit Down, The Dice Tower, the list goes on. We ended up flying out Quintin Smith from Shut Up &amp; Sit Down and Tom Vasel from Dice Tower, and they were awesome about giving us feedback. I remember Quintin telling us that he enjoyed the game but didn&rsquo;t feel like he&rsquo;d play it again, and he recommended doing a campaign with modular boards since that would keep him engaged. This change would represent a lot more work, since we would be taking that core structure and making/balancing around ten more missions around it, but deep down we all knew he was right. We went back to the drawing board and completely pivoted. We brought in another designer (Rick  Ernst) to help work on crafting scenarios as well as damage and boss decks, and we pressed onward.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>*TESTING IN PROGRESS!\\n*</em>\\nPlaytesting was a huge part of the process from there. Luckily, Riot is a place filled with core gamers, so we had lots of opportunities to do playtests with different types of gamers from the office. And we needed to do a lot of playtesting, especially for balancing the AI, since in co-op you really want the players to have to gamble on how to win, and get through by the skin of their teeth. The real solve for that, other than getting to work with great designers (which I&rsquo;ve been lucky to have), is just playtesting over and over again, and then over and over again (and again), and then bringing in brand new eyes and seeing if your experience sticks. Then someone will say &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t lost here in a long time, it should be a little harder&rdquo; and we&rsquo;ll make a tweak. It&rsquo;s not sexy&mdash;just constant iterations over a long period of time&mdash;but it&rsquo;s happy work, because it&rsquo;s out of love for the game that you&rsquo;re making and the players you&rsquo;re making it for. </p>\\n\\n<p>One landmine we were particularly afraid of was quarterbacking: when one player basically solves the game, and that person ends up puppeting the entire group. It&rsquo;s a scary risk for a complex co-op game, and we actively fought against it. We actually had a version that went too far, and it no longer felt like players could collaborate at all, and it wasn&rsquo;t fun. We eventually found a balance we were happy with, with each player becoming an expert on their own mech&rsquo;s command line. We knew things were going better when in-game conversations started focusing less on tactics and more on objectives: a player might see a minion squeaking through the gate and ask the team: &ldquo;can you get there?&rdquo; or &ldquo;who can handle this?&rdquo; instead of focusing on how that other player should build out their mech. It felt like a much healthier place for the game to land.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>*WHO YOU CALLIN&rsquo; LITTLE?\\n*</em>\\nThe majority of this work was done by a very small team, starting with three or four people and then later having five to seven people. We&rsquo;ve come a long way, and I&rsquo;m super proud of this team for working out of love for what we&rsquo;re doing. I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to play MvM a couple thousand times at this point and I still love playing it; I&rsquo;m still proud of the gameplay and the work that was done. I&rsquo;m also very happy to have worked with some of the external partners that helped us in the manufacturing of the game, which I plan to talk about in my next post!</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks,</p>\\n\\n<p>-Chris &#039;Kades&#039; Cantrell</p>\\n', 'title': 'Dev Blog 2:  WHAT GOES INTO DESIGNING A BOARD GAME?'} 63611825516608000\n",

We don&rsquo;t have the luxury of online matchmaking, but wanted the replayability and depth that a good, online PvP experience would be able to provide, and we felt closer to those goals when the game was fully co-op. We also wanted the game to be fun for the experienced player as well as the brand new player, even if they&rsquo;re in the same game. We went through a LOT of testing to get as close to that mark as we could, and we plan to spend the next post talking about those design&mdash;and testing&mdash;challenges.

Each turn, the player can add one of these abilities to their command line, and soon the mech has a series of commands that it executes every turn. The idea is to build out a minion-stomping machine that you masterfully pilot through the mission&mdash;but it&rsquo;s easy to run into technical difficulties, especially once you start taking damage. In our games, we kept driving into walls, or bumping into teammates, or wandering the wrong way altogether. We asked ourselves: what kind of champs would accidentally walk into lava?

NOC notifies engineers, who investigate and fiddle with config changes. Then, additional hardware is scaled up to handle extra load, and the problem is resolved. An additional code change is scheduled to permanently fix the underlying problem. </p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>Elevated error rate causing login issues(2/7, ~30 minutes)</strong> NOC is notified that error rates are reaching unacceptable levels. NOC techs cycle the boxes running the programs, which solves the problem. </p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>Player in Game (PIG) loss due to unknown reasons (2/10, ~8 minutes)</strong> Automated alerting notifies the NOC that PIG dropped mysteriously. PIG recovers shortly, but investigations into why that happened find no root cause. </p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>NA players report inability to patch Riot Client (2/11, ~10 hours)</strong> NOC is notified by PS that they’ve gotten a large volume of support requests due to an inability to patch the Riot Client. Investigation points to an issue with timeouts. Engineers point software towards a different box, which fixes the routing issues causing the problem. </p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>Issues with game starts (2/14, ~20 minutes)</strong> Automated alerting notifies the NOC that game starts are impacted. Before an investigation can be spun up, game starts resume normal metrics, and further watching doesn’t show any additional problems.</p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>Signups API failure(2/21, ~6 minutes)</strong> Automated alerting notifies the NOC that signups have reported 0 signups for 5 minutes. NOC tech takes a look and notices that one of the backend connection nodes isn’t transmitting data. Routing around the impacted node fixes the problem while the node is rebooted. </p></li>\\n<li><p><strong>CPU Usage too high - Mitigation steps (2/22, ~89 minutes)</strong> CPU usage hitting warning levels due to Clash. In response, practice games are set to 10 player minimums and then the practice tool is disabled too.
